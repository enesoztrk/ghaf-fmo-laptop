      - name: Maximize space available on rootfs
        # Why not use https://github.com/easimon/maximize-build-space directly?
        # The reason is: we want to maximize the space on rootfs, since that's
        # where the nix store (`/nix/store`) is located. Github action
        # https://github.com/easimon/maximize-build-space maximizes
        # the builder space on ${GITHUB_WORKSPACE}, which is not what we need.
        # Alternatively, we could move the nix store to ${GITHUB_WORKSPACE}
        # and use https://github.com/easimon/maximize-build-space as such, but
        # we suspect other tooling (e.g. cachix) would not work well with such
        # configuration.
